# Coding Interview Prep

Structured Python practice for data structures and algorithms (DSA) interviews.  
The problems are organized by pattern/topic, loosely following the [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/) track.

This repo is meant for anyone preparing for roles that require strong problem-solving skills — including software engineering, quant resarch, and data-focused positions.

## Focus Areas

- Core algorithms and data structures
- Pattern recognition (e.g. sliding window, two pointers, backtracking)
- Clean, readable Python with type annotations
- Practical interview readiness over over-engineered solutions

## Directory Structure

Each folder represents a topic or problem-solving pattern.  
File names reflect the problem and approach used.

Example:
```text
/two_pointers
├── two_sum_ii.py                # Easy – Two Pointers
├── container_with_most_water.py # Medium – Greedy
```

## Notes

- Python 3.10+
- Optional tools used for local linting/testing: `black`, `mypy`, `pytest`
- Problems sourced from Leetcode, Neetcode, and similar platforms
