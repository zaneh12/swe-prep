# SWE Prep

Structured practice for software engineering interviews using Python.  
Organized by pattern/topic, based primarily on the [Neetcode 150](https://neetcode.io/).  
Solutions are written with clarity and maintainability in mind — not just to pass.

## Focus Areas

- Core data structures and algorithms
- Problem-solving patterns (e.g. sliding window, two pointers, recursion)
- Clean, readable Python code
- Type annotations, edge case handling, and simplicity

## Directory Structure

Each folder corresponds to a common topic or pattern.  
Inside: Python solutions with inline explanations and file names reflecting the problem.

Example:
arrays/
├── two_sum.py
├── best_time_to_buy_sell_stock.py

## Notes

- Python 3.10+
- Optional tools used for local linting/testing: `black`, `mypy`, `pytest`
- Problems sourced from Leetcode, Neetcode, and similar platforms
